I got an email from a guy I went to high

school with, right? Email said, Kev,

it's time for you to get yours. I open

up the email. It's two pictures in an

email. One picture was a real little

man standing next to a doctor.

He was angry. Next picture.

That same little man was taller than

the doctor. He was giving a thumbs up.

Bottom of the email said, Kev, it's

time for you to get yours.

I'm confused. What the f*** is going

on? I call him Yo, I got your email.

What the f*** are you talking about?

What are you trying to say? I said,

what do you mean, what am I trying to

say? Say exactly what I said.

What is this? What are you trying to

say? He said that they given our

height, go get you some.

F***. You mean they're giving out

height? Exactly what I said.

They're giving out height. They're

taking the fat out of people's backs.

Putting it in their knee.

They take it.

They've taken a fat out of people's

backs, put it in their knee.

He said, Go get rid of your back fat.

Get yourself some inches.

I said I will do no such thing.

Get rid of my goddamn back fat.

43 years old.

I've been five five my whole life.

Five, four, five.

Two and a half. My whole f***ing life.

Have to do no shit like that.

You got to remember, I ain't been on

tour, like, four years.

I can't just walk out this bitch.

Six, six and not say shit about it.

I just walk out.

What up. What up. What up. What up?

What up? What's going on?

What the f*** is going on with you?

Look at his goddamn knees.

What did he do to his knees?

Why? He got all them holes in his back.

What the f*** he do to his back?

You know what I want.

I want people to start thinking shit

through. I want to get back to the

times of people who had patience.

You got to slow down, start thinking

shit through. Stop acting on impulse.

Let's say I go get the procedure.

I come out of it with these new knees

and these long ass legs.

I'm six six. Look at my f***ing knees

in these long ass legs.

But I still got the same arms.

I didn't do shit to my f***ing arms.

I didn't judge it. Now I can't put my

hands in my pocket because I done f***

up. I'm out in this bitch looking like

a T-Rex touching my chest all the time.

Why Kev always rubbing his chest?

Bitch because I misjudged it.

I can't get my hands in my pocket.

You gotta think shit through.

Let's say I go get the procedure.

I got these goddamn new knees, long ass

legs, my f***ing frame.

Look at my chest and my shoulders.

I'm six six, but I still wear a size

seven sneaker. I didn't do shit to my

feet. Now.

I can't support the new body.

My balance is off.

I look like that. That thing to be at

the car dealerships that.

That air, man. Look at me.

You got to think shit through.

Stop acting on impulse.
