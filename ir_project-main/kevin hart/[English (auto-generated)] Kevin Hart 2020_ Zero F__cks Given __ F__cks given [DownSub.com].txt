know my wife's biggest problem is

chasing her past

trying to redo what she did when she was

younger ladies i'm here to give you a

personal message it's okay to get old

there's nothing wrong with getting old

there's nothing wrong with it stop

fighting

old age the beauty of getting older is

that you get to look back

and realize all the dope [ __ ] that you

overcame and that you did when you were

younger

that's dope stop trying to run

from that stop trying to redo that it's

over it's [ __ ] over

she told me the other day she was like

babe we should go out tonight we should

get [ __ ] up

i said absolutely not no why would i do

that

no it hurts it [ __ ] hurts now

take a shot it gets stuck in my chest

for three to five [ __ ] minutes

my left side shut down i get to shaking

and [ __ ]

i got a fart or [ __ ] i don't know it's

one of them something's happening

making dumb ass faces i described this

to my wife

in great detail you know what her answer

was

you don't ever want to have fun with me

[ __ ] i just described a stroke to you

after the age 40 you know what man you

lose a high level of care

i don't really give a [ __ ] like my wife

want to go out i don't you go honey i

don't give a [ __ ]

i'm serious i don't give a [ __ ] what you

do that's not in the malicious or angry

way i'm serious i don't give a [ __ ] go

have a good time go ladies you don't

know how to not give a [ __ ] that's your

problem

if you guys can match a man's not give a

[ __ ] energy oh my god the world would be

a better place

it'll be a better place but you don't

know how to not give a [ __ ]

you're always searching for a [ __ ]

because you just

you can't you don't process it you can't

figure it out

i'ma tell you the problem ladies and i

want you to listen closely

here's what makes a woman really mad you

guys get upset if a man does not give

you the reaction

that you feel that you would give him

let me say it again ladies you get upset

if a man does not give you the reaction

that you feel that you would give him

hence why you're always searching for a

give a [ __ ]

because on the other side you're like i

would give a [ __ ]

so you should give a [ __ ] that's why you

search for giving [ __ ]

my wife constantly search for them she

wants to go out go out

searching for giving [ __ ] there aren't

don't give a [ __ ]

go i'm excited for you to leave so i can

eat chips off my belly button i don't

give a [ __ ]

go

you can't do it hence you want the same

for men you don't understand

first and foremost stop expecting us to

be as bright and brilliant as you

if a man goes out and he's over 40 years

old i'm here to tell you there is no

plan attached to that

there is no [ __ ] agenda there's no

schedule stop

asking questions because we don't have

the answers

granted i know some insecurities are

bought on because of men and the things

they did in the past

i'm guilty of it but after the age 40 it

goes away

it goes away we don't give a [ __ ] about

[ __ ] we don't care

stop looking for [ __ ] i told her one

time i said i was going out

babe i'm going out where you going i

don't even know yet

we done what the [ __ ] is going on here

am i getting graded what is this i don't

have the answers

i'm failing miserably stop asking me

questions

i can't [ __ ] deal with it there's a

high level

of insecurity sometimes it's not worth

you having ladies

we gotta tell argument one time that's a

[ __ ] argument

two reasons first of all she asked me

this big question i had to explain her

that i didn't know

tell you another secret ladies after men

say we're going out we actually meet

in the parking lot and try to figure out

what the [ __ ] we doing we actually have

another meeting ourselves

so what's the plan i don't know i

thought you had i didn't have it i

thought you did it

nobody got a [ __ ] plan while i'm out

i'm not gonna stay here and do this [ __ ]

i'll go home go to sleep i got back home

early you back home early cause you was

probably with a [ __ ] no i wasn't

i was in the parking lot home depot over

45 minutes

age where i don't argue i just leave

that's my new move
