I think if you get kicked
in the face you deserved it

because that means that
you watched the foot come

to your face.
(audience laughing)

You got to be a asshole to
fight somebody using their feet.

The person I saw get kicked in the face,

the reason why I laughed is
because when he got kicked,

he looked at us for confirmation.

(audience laughing)

Like he needed approval
on what just happened.

He's was like, "Ah, yo, shit, yo!"

(audience laughing)

It was him, yeah.

You better look at his other
foot 'fore he kick you again.

He's good, that guy's good.

He knows what he's doing.

Would you fight somebody
using their feet, man?

Like, if we go to fight, I'ma
tell you put your hands up.

Put your hands up, let's fight.

Now if I gotta fight you
and you start stretching

(audience laughing)

that mean you know some shit I don't know.

I'm not gonna fight you.

I had a incident where a
guy started, well, he tried.

He didn't use it on me,

but he going to attempt to use his feet.

I was with my mom, right?

Me and my mom, we in the
parking lot at Best Buy.

I'm looking for a parking space.

Now, all the spaces was taken,

but there was one truck about
to back into his parking spot

but it was taking too long

so I got mad, I stole it, I
whipped into the spot real fast

"ah, ah" like you know when you wrong

'cause you put your head down
and roll your windows up.

You, don't wanna look at
him, you start humming.

(humming) (audience laughs)

Out of nowhere the guy
got out of the truck,

he was like "Yo man, I know
you saw me about to back

into that spot either you back out

or we gonna have a problem."

Chinese guy, alright?

Now I'm with my mom, so
I ain't gon' be no bitch

so I was like "well I
guess we got a problem."

This is how I know I
didn't want this problem.

This is exactly what he did to me.

He was like "oh, so we
got a problem, do we?"

(audience laughs)

Al, Al got mad at me 'cause I live in LA.

He said "Kevin you out here in Hollywood,

doing God knows what.

Sex,

drugs,

money.

Lord knows what you're in to.

You need to get a relationship with God."

I said dude don't talk to me
about God, I'm fine, okay?

You the one that was on drugs,

you get a relationship with God.

He got mad, now anytime he get mad,

he always gotta bring up
some dark shit from his past

that nobody needs to know.

Out of nowhere he said, "Kevin
let me tell you something,

I know I was drugs, BUT I found Jesus.

Granted, I didn't know him when I was out

there sucking dick for money,
but I'll tell you something".

I said "wait a minute, wait a minute,

hold, first of all you're
not gonna speed past that

like you didn't just
say what you just said."

I said "when was this,
what year was this?"

He said, "it was in the eighties,
everybody was doing it".

This is the shit that
piss me off, "he said.

"Your dad was back there
with me" I said "what!"

My dad was like "all right,
all right, all right.

Hey, you gonna learn today!"

Uh, no the fuck, I'm not!

You gon' keep that lesson to yourself.

How come nothing good
ever happens at work?

It's always bad, "Babe let
me tell you about this bitch

Sabrina, at the office today.

Okay, first of all she comes in office

with white stockings on and black shoes,

"uh excuse me bitch, Labor day is over.

Huh, excuse me, boop, thank
you, backspace, delete that."

Then y'all start talking
about problems going on

in the office, we don't fucking know.

"Let me tell you what she
did babe, she come to me

talking about uh can you go
print this out the fax machine."

"Uh, no I am an executive
administrative assistant,

not your assistant."

We gotta act like we know what's going on.

What? (audience laughs)

She told you to print
it out the fax machine?

Uh uh, no she didn't that
bitch is crazy, not my baby.

"Thank you," then y'all
turn into the computers,

"Thank you, I told the bitch,
boop, backspace, no, LOL,

RTOFMAO, thank you, delete that,

NTFOMOFOHS!"

Out of nowhere my friend Joey goes,

"You better be lucky we
don't have a ping pong table,

if we did, I will bust all y'all ass."

I said bet money bitch, that's me

and my friends biggest
problem, we're competitive.

The word bet, sets off
that competitive nature.

I said, bet money bitch.

Harry said bet.

Wayne, bet.

Spank, bet.

Joey, bet.

Bitch bet, bet, bet, mother fucker bet,

bet, nigga bet, bet,
bet it bitch, bet, bet,

fuck you bet, bet.

(audience laughing)

We get in the car, we drive to Walmart.

We drive to Walmart, we
buy a ping pong table.

We go back to Joey's house,

we set the ping pong
table up in the kitchen.

We get to playing ping pong.

Our game looks nothing like the game,

that we were watching on TV

So we decided to add alcohol into the mix.

Hit the ball into the
net, gotta take a shot.

You get slammed on, gotta take two shots.

You get slammed on and you
miss the ball completely,

gotta take three shots.

Somewhere along the line
the game got so competitive,

that Joey decided to cut
his jeans into jean shorts,

'cause he said he wasn't
getting enough lateral movement

in the house.

Here's the fucked up part about that,

it was Joey's house, all Joey had to do

is go upstairs, and change into a pair

of goddamn jean shorts.

I wake up in the middle of the night,

my stomach is killing me,
I call the front desk.

A woman picked up the phone she said,

"Hello, front desk may I help you?"

It's the first time that I heard English

outside of my friends,
since I've been to Japan.

You woulda thought that I
was Tom Hanks, in Cast Away.

I, lost it.

(dramatic cries) (audience laughs)

Chicken!

Please, chicken!

She was like, "sir calm down, calm down.

What room are you in?"

I don't, I don't know, I don't know.

She said, "Look at the phone,

your room number is on the phone."

Okay, I'm, I'm in room, I'm in room

line line dash cross house?

I don't know how to read it.

It looks like a, it looks
like an abandoned building

with no windows, made
out of bamboo sticks,

I don't know,

so excited,

I don't know.

Help!

Did you get it, did you get the joke?

You got it?

'Cause the way they right
they numbers, you got it?

I just felt like you
shoulda gave a bigger laugh

I don't think your laugh is,
is what it shoulda been now.

True story people, exactly what I do.

Get in the shower, get
dressed, get in my car,

start driving to the store.

On the way to the store,
I hit a speed bump,

when I hit the speed bump,

I hear a lotta noise in the trunk.

(loud booming)

That's weird, I ain't
put shit in the trunk.

The fuck is all that noise,
in the goddamn trunk?

I'm small, I get scared fast.

So, I get out the car, I pop the trunk,

this some true shit, I pop the
trunk, when I pop the trunk,

this bitch was stooped down
in the trunk like this,

looking at me.

I see her in the goddamn trunk.

I see her see me see her,
in the goddamn trunk.

I just caught you, in the trunk of my car.

You gotta say something to justify

what the fuck I'm looking at.

The fuck are you doing
in the goddamn trunk?

With a straight face, she looks at me,

jumps out the trunk, rolls her eyes

and takes off, as if I never saw her.

Now let me tell you why I had a attitude.

I had a attitude because we live together,

like I'm gonna see you tonight.

We have to address this,
at some point in time.

I said no fuck that, we're
gonna talk about this right now.

I get in the car, I drive home.

Here's where it gets crazier.

When I get home, she in
the kitchen cooking, right?

I walk in the house, she
said, "hey baby, you hungry?"

Bitch, what the?

Oh, wait, I don't wanna
talk about no goddamn food.

I wanna talk about why I popped the trunk

and you popped out the goddamn trunk

like a goddamn Jack in the Box.

The fuck were you doing,
in the goddamn trunk?

With a straight face she
looked at me, she said,

"I wasn't in no goddamn
trunk." (audience laughs)

(upbeat music)
