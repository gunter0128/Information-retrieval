trainer man guy had

amazing talent underneath his belt

golden glove fighters

junior olympics like i mean it was so

much lightweight champions

train me

he said kevin if you take me on i'll

make you the best fighter there was i

said well that's too much

i don't want that i just want to get

good he said done

he became my trainer got to be honest

with you he was [ __ ] good

made me good told me [ __ ] i thought i

would never hear

compare me to boxers that i've never

heard of but it still was a compliment

told me i reminded him of a fighter

named lefty lou earl

he said kevin do you know who that is i

said no i do not

he said i'm gonna bring you a tape you

got a vcr

no no i do not the thing that made me

laugh when i told him i didn't have a

vcr he was like

like like i was in the wrong year i

can't believe you don't have vcr goddamn

why do you still have vcr sir told me

that i had one of the best jabs you've

ever seen

said kevin your jab reminds me of

lightning coming from your shoulders

lightning coming from your [ __ ]

shoulders

he said have you ever thought about

fighting i said no he said what about

sparring

i said no but i would that's all i need

to hear tomorrow 6 a.m i'm set you up

6 a.m i come to the gym you got a guy

near my height my bill

mouthpiece

vaseline all on my face and all of my

headgear i said what's this for

he said so the punches slide off

but we we never talked okay well we

didn't discuss that but all right

okay all right that's what it's going to

do that's what it's going to do

he gets done putting vaseline in my face

he walks out the ring i said wait you

talking to me he's got to be talking to

me

i yell back got you coach put a

confident laugh behind it

we get to our corners the bell rings

ding i come out i just want him to see

that i can fight

you could sound like a [ __ ] fight by

the way i hold my shoulders look how i'm

moving

hmm my feet are spaced apart look at my

[ __ ] foot move look how i'm [ __ ]

moving [ __ ]

this ain't gonna be no cake walk yeah

you see it he flat-footed oh

he's not even on the balls of his foot

i'ma whoop his ass

i'm getting more confidence as i move

around

my coach says kevin stop playing let

your hands go

all right ask and you shall

receive i hope he got the weather

channel

cause this is about to be some lightning

when you throw a jab you take a step

take a step let the jab go the same time

turn it over

what every time what what that's how you

throw it

i take my step i'm about to turn it over

i'm right here here it is

about to turn that [ __ ] over you better

brush yourself here come

here oh he's coming right here i'm right

here

but i'm about to get here here i am but

i'm about to [ __ ] get right there you

better brace yourself i'm right here

before i did that

he hit me i i immediately lost my vision

immediately i went blind immediately

couldn't see [ __ ] everything was [ __ ]

black ah

i ran that you can get brain damage or

you can die from a punch i just lost

my [ __ ] vision i i don't have

eyesight no more

i can't see i panicked i turned around

i've been known to do this move several

times

i start punching backwards talk about it

in my past specials

i'm a backwards puncher when i panic i

[ __ ] start punching

my trainer said kevin throw the jab

throw the jab

i said for what liar

it ain't lightning unless he's a storm

tracker okay because this is

[ __ ] ridiculous i'm blind i can't see

[ __ ]

i'm blind ring the bell ring the [ __ ]

bell

the bell rings i can't even get to the

corner i got to follow his voice

to the corner ah as i get to the corner

my trainer he's like what's wrong i said

i'm blind man i can't [ __ ] see

he just he just lift my head gear up

apparently when he hit me he knocked my

head gear over my eyes

it was black so i was just looking at

the back of it the whole time

he was like why didn't you lift it up

and i said cause we never went over that

in practice

i didn't know how to do that i think you

put too much vaseline on me that's why i

was sliding all over the place

sliding all over the [ __ ] pace man i

want to do this no more

he said you just gonna quit i said i

don't call it quitting i just wanna do

something else

he said what do you wanna tell him i

said i'm never talking to him again in

my [ __ ] life

my lawyer gonna talk to him he's going

to jail i bet you that

he's going to [ __ ] jail after this

what he did to me tonight was assault

that's what the [ __ ] this was

salt at the highest level i quit

walked away from boxing that day walked

away never went back

later on i decided to look up some tape

on lefty lurl i wouldn't have found this

guy

because i want to know who he was who

are you comparing me to

after that display of boxing that i gave

i wanted to see who the [ __ ] was

like me or who was i like

turns out lefty lou earl had one arm

he was a handicapped fighter he was one

in 38. his one win came from

disqualification he got

knocked out kicked him in the face

that's why they gave him the w

but he had a squeaky voice so my trainer

was talking about my voice all this

[ __ ] time i had nothing to do with my

fighting style

just so having to compare me to a

handicapped fighter

i know i'm gonna get a lot of [ __ ] after

this joke from [ __ ] one-armed people

and someone cancel me next i don't

[ __ ] know

good news is that raleigh ain't gonna

last long because they can't hold them

signs for too long

because they only got one they don't get

tired they got to put their arms down

i was so happy man after i sparked

because that was the first sign

that i was back to myself of old i

started sparring

after my accident you guys don't know a

year ago got into a real bad car

accident

almost [ __ ] died man damn they was

paralyzed a lot of bad [ __ ] happened

i was in hospital for a minute thought

about a lot

because i thought about a lot i'm now

able to ask you things that i know that

you haven't thought about

question number one is do you have an

ass wiper

in your life think about it an

ass wiper somebody that will wipe your

ass

if [ __ ] hit the fan for the rest of your

life if need be

you don't think you need it until you

[ __ ] need it

see after my surgery i went eight days

without going to the bathroom i was

constipated

they wouldn't let me leave the hospital

until i went to the bathroom i had to

make sure your organs were working

had somebody by my side every single day

on day nine there was a 20-minute gap

when i was by myself

during this 20 minute gap it felt like

somebody threw a stick of dynamite

in my [ __ ] stomach and that [ __ ]

exploded

bathroom
