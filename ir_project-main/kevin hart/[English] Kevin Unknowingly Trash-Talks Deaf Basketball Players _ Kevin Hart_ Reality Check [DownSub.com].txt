One thing I used to do, I used to play a

lot of basketball, right?

I would go up to gyms and just do open

runs. I had to stop going to one gym

because they turned it into a picture

fest. Everybody want to take f***ing

pictures. I ain't here to take pictures

here to play ball. I'm not coming back

to this gym. I go find another gym

where they do three on three basketball

Tuesdays and Thursdays, 6 a.m.

to 8 a.m.. It's much better.

That's what I need to be. It's more

intimate. Keep in mind, when I play

basketball, I'll talk a lot of s***.

F*** out of here, bitch.

You're too small. I'll put you in my

back pocket with your little ass.

You're too f***ing small.

Put you right in my back pocket.

I'm about to get buckets.

It's time to eat. Keep in mind when I

talk s***. I don't like it when you

don't talk s*** back. You're messing up

the competitive nature in the game.

If I talk s***, talk s*** back.

You playing three on three basketball?

They treat me like it's the goddamn NBA

calling plays, setting picks and s***.

It was too much. We lost.

I quit. I'm not playing anymore.

I walked out, there was a sign in the

lobby. The sign in the lobby said, Deaf

run Tuesdays and Thursdays, 6 a.m.

to 8 a.m.. Yeah.

They were deaf. They didn't hear s***.

I said now.

No, they didn't.

They weren't. They weren't calling

plays. They were communicating.

They were talking to one another.

Now, this isn't a joke about deaf

people. That's not what the joke is

about. It's about what I look like.

What the f*** did I look like back

there? Cause I know what I was saying.

I'm talking s***. Yeah. B****.

Yeah. B****. Yeah. You're too small.

Put you on my f***ing back pocket with

your little ass. Yeah.

Come on, b****. I'm about to get

buckets. Barbecue chicken.

That's what I said. What does that look

like without the volume? What does it

look like without the volume?

I just told that man I want to eat his

ass. That's what I just said.

I don't want to eat your ass.

That's barbecued chicken, bitch.

Barbecue chicken.

I'm not trying to eat your ass.

Had to leave a note. Apologize.
