Wish I could be
a rapper or some shit.

I really do.

You know why I can't
be a rapper, though, man?

Because my voice
ain't deep enough.

To be a rapper,
you need a deep voice.

That's the only way people
gonna want to listen to you

on a regular basis.

I don't think nobody
would buy my album

because my voice
is too small.

Yeah, bitch, I'm a killer.

I shoot you in your face.

Everybody gonna die.

Every...

body gonna die tonight.

did he just say...

I'm not buyin'
that shit if he said...

ain't no way.

Certain shit just keeps you
from being tough.

You wanna know what's really
keeping me from being tough?

Look at this.

This is really holding me back.

Look at this shit here.
Look at this.

Look at this shit.
Look at this shit.

This is really
fucking me up, man.

Ain't nothin' tough
about this.

It don't matter
what you say,

Ain't nobody gonna take you
serious if you swing your feet.

It don't matter.

I will kill everybody
in this bitch tonight!

I ain't fucking playing
with y'all.

Y'all think
this is a game?

No, I'm sick of it.

I'm sick of the way
people treat me around here.

Would you talk to a guy
who swung his feet?

If you at a club
and I tried to talk to you?

"Come here, baby, let me
holler at you for a second.

"You, girl, you know damn
well who I'm talking to.

"Wait a second.

"Let me climb down
and get my feet together.

Wait a minute now."

Rappers make me
laugh, though.

I swear rappers
are funny, man.

You ever see
rappers freestyle?

Like when they be
battling each other?

You ever notice the
more angry a rapper gets,

the higher his hands get?

You ever notice that?

They start off so calm.

This is rappers
when they freestyle.

Like, the dude--this is the
dude when he's listening

to the other guy.

"You ready?"

"No, I got him.
I got him, B."

Wait, this is really
how they be, look.

"Real talk."

I need a straight
look though.

Hey.

This is how--

This is how the rapper--

I'm really trying to be
a rapper right now.

Like, this--

This is the real
angry rapper.

"Real talk.

I kill niggas.

I slay niggas
that don't love it.

Nigga, you wanna
beat me to get it,

I get it back!"

Oh shit!

The other dude,
he's so confused.

"Oh, shit, this
nigga's crazy!"

He be trying
to follow his hands.

"This nigga's crazy.
He's about to kill me.

He's gonna cap me
or something."

I can't be that guy, man.

I want to be.

There's so much stuff
that I wanted to do

that I'm realizing now
that I can't do.

Like, I wanted
to be a singer.

I wanted to be an R&B
singer for a long time.

But I can't sing, but
I can dance my ass off.

If anybody here
is trying to be a singer,

I'm about to tell you what
you need to know to make it.

All right?

This is more classified stuff.

All you need to know how
to do is open your hands,

close them, and point.

That's it.

I know it sounds crazy.

You're like, "what?"

But I'm telling y'all,
it look good.

Watch this.

I'm not gonna sing nothing.

But tell me this don't look like
I'm about to say some stuff.

Look at this.

"Oh, shit!

"He gonna sing something!

When he gonna sing, girl?"

That or the slide out.

You know what
the slide out is?

You ever see an old group,

when an old group
be in the thing?

Like The Temptations
or somebody,

you never know
who the lead singer is,

so they slide out.

They be like this.

They slide out and start
singing on you.

That's the best shit ever.

'Cause they be talking shit.

"These bitches don't even
know what's about to hit them.

I'm about to slide
out on her.

Ooh."

"He's good. This guy
is good, he's good."
