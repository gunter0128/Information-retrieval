Having fun is a very difficult job.

The reason why I say that

is because kids don't know
how to shut fun off.

Kids think fun lasts forever.

I'll tell you the scariest shit
in the world for a man to see

after a long day at work.

Long day at work, you get home,
you put your key in the door,

you open up that door real slow.

Scariest shit in the world
for a man to see

is that baby with all that energyÂ 
on the other side.

"Oh, yeah!

Daddy home. It's time to play.

I want to play, Daddy.

I've been taking naps with Mommy all day.

I want to play that game where you try
to close your eyelids

and I keep opening them back up.

Oh, yeah.

It's time to play, Daddy."

I make a bet.

I make a bet right now to every man
in this room that has a child,

has done what I'm about to say
at least one time.

At least one time.

Long day at work, you're in your car,
driving home.

You pull in your driveway.

When you pull in your driveway,
that baby with all that energy

runs to the window,
opens up the blinds.

Oh, yeah!

Daddy home. It's time to play.

You see the baby in the blinds.

The baby sees you. You and the baby are
looking at each other.

You locked eyes with a goddamn baby.

You're staring at the baby,
the baby staring at you.

And you back out the driveway.

You back out the goddamn driveway.

Fuck that baby today.

I'd rather go back to work and throw boxes
at the goddamn wall

than deal with that baby today.

"Where are you going, Daddy?"

"Fuck you, baby.

Fuck you, baby."
