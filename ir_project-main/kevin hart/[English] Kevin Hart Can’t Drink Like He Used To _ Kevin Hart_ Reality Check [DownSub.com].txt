I am working on my sh*t, man.

Certain things I just can't do anymore.

Not like I used to. I stopped drinking.

I don't drink as much as I used to.

Not because I had a problem.

Just because I'm getting older, I still

drink. I love to drink.

I have a f***ing tequila Grand Camino.

You guys should know that I love to f***ing

drink. That mean-o lean-no, You need it in

your life. Trust me.

I just can't drink the way I used to when I

was 22, 23 years old.

I take shots for days.

Bao Bao Bao dance afterwards.

Yeah. B*tch. 43 is different.

It's different at 43.

One shot.

Bao.

Some. Somebody put something in my drink.

Somebody's trying to do something to me here

tonight.

I'm a blackout drunk, too.

I'll black out in a heartbeat.

I'll black the f*** out mid-conversation.

What are we doing? We're going.

We're going. We're going to club.

Everybody. Everybody gonna come up.

We all- [Snore] I'm out.

It's. I don't like my friends.

These son of a bitches never take me home

when I black out. They just prop me up in

the corner. Keep the party going cause they

need my face to get in the places they need

my f***ing face.

They treat me like Bernie from Weekend at

Bernie's. They just keep showing my face at

the door.

Get in there, Kev. B*tch, I'm dead.

Check my pulse.

My friends are hilarious, man.

I recently had to have a conversation with

my friends, had a big conversation with him.

I had to explain to my friends that I'm no

longer the friend of old.

I'm no longer the all for one, one for all

friend. I'm no longer do we ride together.

We die together. I'm no longer the If one

goes down, we all go down.

I'm no longer that friend.

43 years old. I'm at a point in my life

where I'm not choosing to deal with the

world of bullsh*t that comes with my

friends. I no longer want your bullsh*t.

I'm not embracing it anymore.

I'm at a point in my life I'm very serious,

very serious.

I'm at a point in my life where I tell on

you. I'll f***ing tell.

I told him.

That's where I'm at. You do something around

me that involves the law in any way, shape

or form. I'll f***ing tell.

I'll tell. It doesn't make me a snitch or a

b*tch. You know why?

You know why? Because I'm telling you ahead

of time. What the f*** I'll do.

That means I'm giving you an opportunity to

make better decisions around me so that I

don't have to tell on you. I don't want to

have to f***ing tell on you.
