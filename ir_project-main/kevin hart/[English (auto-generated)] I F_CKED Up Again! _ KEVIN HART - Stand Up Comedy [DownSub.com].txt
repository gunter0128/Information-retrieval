you know what i love the most about my

kids

i love that my kids don't add stress

to my life i got enough stress going on

as it is

i want marriage number two that within

the self is stressful

the reason why i sir is because this

marriage has to work

it has to you don't want to get to

marriage three four and five when you

get there

at that point you're not even looking

for love you're just looking for a death

buddy you're looking for somebody to die

with

you try and die together yes or no i die

with you if you die with me you wanna

die together

crazy thing about my relationship is

that it's on display

everybody can see it everybody can judge

it i don't give a [ __ ]

i don't care it's the bed i made for

myself i lay in it

what makes me laugh is when people act

like they live my

life like you walk in my shoes [ __ ] hit

the fan for me in my marriage

everybody had an opinion

kevin hart did it again kevin hart

[ __ ]

up again i want to make something

perfectly clear to everybody here

tonight

i'm not [ __ ] up again okay in my first

marriage

i filed for divorce that means that i

chose to leave that means that i made a

better decision

for me in my life that's not [ __ ] up

that's me

moving on okay [ __ ] up yes yes

but i don't like it when people act like

you plan to [ __ ] up

nobody plans to [ __ ] up that's why it's

called the [ __ ] up

you don't walk outside like today's the

perfect day for a [ __ ] up i'm

i'm i'm [ __ ] up all day today this is

this is [ __ ] up weather that's what this

is that's

that's not how it happens the important

thing is to learn from it

you got to learn from your fuck-ups

lesson number one that i learned

is that whatever happens in vegas does

not stay

in vegas don't believe that [ __ ]

that commercial is a goddamn lie she'll

be taken off the television

for the first time in my life i had to

look in the mirror i had to look in the

mirror i had to have a conversation

with myself god damn it kevin what are

you doing what are you doing

you're almost 40 years old you're still

doing the same dumb [ __ ] grow up

grow up let me realize i had to grow up

that meant had to go back to my wife

make my wife feel secure and

understanding that i was done doing the

dumb [ __ ]

that put me in heavy kiss my wife's ass

mode that's a bad place to be fellas

i don't know if you have been there or

not but it's a [ __ ] up place you do

the same thing every day yup

yup whatever you need whatever you need

this is all you do every day yep yep i

got it i got it i got it i got it i got

it

i dude i do that dude i do not do it

every day

with that being said now when you try to

fight to make sure this woman feels

secure you end up becoming insecure as a

man

the reason why is because you're

questioning yourself is she happy

is she satisfied is sex so good i'm an

ask her nope i can't

if i ask her i look weak now you start

searching true story

i went out i bought a mirror put it on

my ceiling for no reason at all it was a

tuesday this is a true story

you don't do no [ __ ] like that on a

tuesday that's a weekend move not a

tuesday morning

it was all good until i caught a

reflection of myself in that mirror when

we were [ __ ] let me tell you

something people

whatever you think you look like when

you [ __ ] i promise you

you don't look like that i promise you

i'm not talking about you posing

in front of the mirror i'm talking about

an unexpected glimpse

of yourself in the goddamn mirror i saw

the bottom of my feet

i have never been more disgusted with

myself as a man that's why i saw the

bottom of my goddamn feet

my feet were black as [ __ ] where was i

at i didn't wear shoes today jesus

christ i wouldn't [ __ ] nobody with feet

like this that's disgusting

my back was ashy i had bumps on my ass

when my ass break out like this

had a full batch of measles on my ass

and didn't know it

i immediately booked the doctor's

appointment y'all got to fix this i got

braille on my butt this is disgusting

whenever you go through any insecurities

especially when it comes every man in

this room

has turned to porn at some point in time

stupid [ __ ] that a man can do

here's why i say it's stupid we don't

give people to do porn

enough credit and enough respect those

people are professional actors

and actresses that's what they do for a

living

you can't just watch that [ __ ] and go

home and try it it don't work like that

that's like watching a karate movie

going outside getting in the fight

telling everybody to back up so you can

roundhouse kick this [ __ ] in the head

you don't know how to do that kick it's

the same thing with porn

i'm not speaking to you from a

hypothetical place i've been there i've

done it i've tried it

i watched porn with my wife tried to do

the [ __ ] that i saw

i was nervous about it so i was having a

conversation with myself should i do it

should i [ __ ] do it should i try it i

had good kevin on this side bad kevin

was on this side

good kevin popped up good kevin had on a

pair of khakis and a v-neck sweater he

said absolutely not don't do it

as a good woman you talk to her first

bad kevin popped up

bag kevin had on a pair of leather pants

and a fishnet tank top and he was doing

this bad kevin

bad kevin said you gonna listen to a man

with khakis on no

no he said do it then do it

out of nowhere i spit on my wife it's

quick right in the [ __ ] forehead

a lugie right in her goddamn forehead

nothing it was quiet

out of nowhere she was like you just

[ __ ] spit on me

the complete opposite reaction from the

lady in the porn

the lady in the porn went crazy when it

happened she was like

this spit making me so hot ah

[Music]

this spit gonna make me come

in my mind i was like that's how you

make them come you gotta spit on their

[ __ ] heads i've been doing it wrong

all this time i haven't told my wife

you're not doing it right you got to rub

it in that's how you [ __ ] come

i had to go downstairs get a baby wipe

clean her head off that was embarrassing

i go to get back in the bed she want to

talk about it what did i tell you guys i

don't like to talk

let it float in the air and disappear i

don't want to talk about it

as soon as i get into bed she was like

did you really just spit on me

i almost lied i almost lied

even though i noticed she know that i

know i did it i almost [ __ ] lie

the reason why is because bad kevin

popped back up bad

kevin was like say it was a leak in the

ceiling i said no

get the hell out of here bad kevin

yes yes i spit on you

i was watching porn i saw some [ __ ] i

tried it

she said kevin let me tell you something

i don't care if you watch porn

don't be stupid enough to bring the [ __ ]

you saw in our house

she said i watch porn all the time i

don't try to do the [ __ ] that i saw

to you i said uh back

the [ __ ] up

when did this become a whorehouse

[Applause]

the hell you mean you watching porn what

the hell are you watching

she was like everything

instantly it got hurt the reason why it

hurt me

is because i [ __ ] couldn't separate

my pride from reality

this is a problem that all men have see

reality is that she wouldn't watch porn

she can watch porn

if i want to watch porn i could watch

porn that's how it should be

for my pride my pride wouldn't let it be

that way my pride wanted to know

what she was watching i want to see it

let me see it with my eyes

i want to see it she said you want to

see it let me see it

she got a laptop open it up she said my

porn search

is in my cookies all you got to do is

search my cookies

i said well you better get me a glass of

milk cause i'm about to eat all these

goddamn cookies

the [ __ ] the reason why is because her

porn search

was a complete opposite of who i am

everything i saw was big everything

was big big balls to the walls big

backs on big blacks big [ __ ] and socks

what the [ __ ] is going on

what one of the sights wasn't even porn

one of the sites was a bunch of tall men

being active

they were changing light bulbs putting

[ __ ] on shelves

hanging paintings what kind of sick [ __ ]

is this what the [ __ ] is this

she was like what you can't do none of

that stuff i like that stuff

[Music]

i went out i bought me one of them grab

sticks after that you know those sticks

they got the claw on it did you grab

stuff i only bought one i didn't tell

her

i just put it under my bed waiting for

the next time he was having sex i was

like yo

crooked she was like

get somebody to come and fix it you know

i was like or not and i [ __ ]

trying to tell y'all man
