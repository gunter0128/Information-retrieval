i know it's not gonna rub off on my kids

you know this pandemic actually gave me

a chance to spend a lot of time with my

kids

a lot of [ __ ] time with my kids for

the first time i realized my kids are a

little spoiled

they're a little spoiled but it's not

about choice it's about circumstances

i have good kids my kids are great

[ __ ] kids i gotta be honest man

i got very lucky i got great kids but

because of their circumstances

they're a little spoiled for example my

kids have been flying private since

they've been born they didn't ask for

that

they were born into that they only

traveled with me

the first time they traveled outside of

me was doing this pandemic with my

ex-wife

went back to philadelphia with their mom

to go see their grandma

my kids called me from the airport you

would have thought

you would have thought my kids were in

baghdad i've never seen

a higher level of panic in my [ __ ]

life call me from the airport dad

what's happening my daughter was like

they're taking my lotions and my

toothpaste what am i supposed to do

son snatched the phone what the [ __ ] is

going on

dad they won't let me take my bags on

the plane they said i can't take my

backpacks and my pulleys and my duffy's

saying i gotta put my games underneath

life with your mother all right there's

a difference

do because i never thought twice about

them

one as we are walking to the front of

the line you do not

make eye contact with none of these

[ __ ] people in this room

you hear me you keep your eyes

straight ahead and you don't [ __ ]

look

left or right until we get to the front

of the line

these people are going to say things

things

be
