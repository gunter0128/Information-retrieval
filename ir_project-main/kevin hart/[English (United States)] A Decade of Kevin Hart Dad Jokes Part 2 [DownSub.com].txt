(upbeat music)

- My kids caught me and my wife fuckin'.

Let, let's, let's just start.
(audience laughing)

Let's just start here. There's
no real way to ease into it.

So I just gotta go for it. Okay.

Both kids, both kids caught
us fuckin', if it was one,

it wouldn't have been
that bad, but it was both.

My son saw us first.
I saw him when he saw us.

'Cause he called his sister. He was like,

"c'mere, hurry up, c'mere,
c'mere, c'mere, c'mere!"

(audience laughing)

The crazy thing is I
couldn't even get mad.

I couldn't get mad at 'em
because they came in my room,

based off of a rule that I put in place.

I don't like locked doors in my house.

Don't lock your goddamn door.

I think the worst thing in the
world for a parent is to not

be able to get in his child's
room, when he wants to.

Don't lock your goddamn door!

Especially my daughter.
I told her, I said,

"you lock that door again I promise you,

I'm gonna kick the door down,

Don't lock that goddamn door again."

I go to get into my daughter
room, the door locked.

I said, "what I said I was going to do?"

"Didn't I say I was gonna
kick that door down?"

She said, "wait, I'm almost finished."

Ohh. Oh my God.
(audience laughing)

Oh my God!

In my mind, I thought the worst.

In my mind, she was cooking cocaine.

That-- that's what I believe.
(audience laughing)

She's gotta be.
(air whooshing)

Doggy style is tough.
That's a tough one.

Ass naked doggy style in
the middle of the bed.

That's, that's tough to
play off, you caught.

Like what-- what do you do?

(laughing)
What do you do?

Oh, shit!
(audience laughing)

You got one move.

You got one move.

You gotta make it look like
you playing American football.

You just got to,
"hut, hut, hut, hut, hut!"

(audience laughing)

Get your ass outta here, we're
going over football plays.

Get outta here!

We're playing against a couple

from down the street this week.

Get your ass up outta here!

(audience laughing)

My biggest fear was, I didn't want my kids

to try to talk to me about what they saw.

Please. God, don't let my kids

talk to me about the shit that they saw.

I'm a firm believer in letting
information float in the air

and disappear. I don't
like to talk about it.

Let it float in the air and disappear.

I go downstairs in the kitchen.
I see my son in the kitchen.

My son gave me a look that
said that he wanted to ask me

about what he just saw.

I gave him a look back that said,

"don't you fuckin' ask me!"

(audience laughing)

"About nothin' that you just saw."

And I knew, I knew he wasn't
really gonna try to ask me,

because he got in trouble with
school, earlier that week.

I had to take my son phone from him,

which is the worst things
you can do to a child.

Taking the kid's phone is detrimental

to a child's lifestyle. As
soon as I took his phone,

he immediately turned to a
crack head instantly, instantly.

I said, "give me the phone,
give me the phone, you're not

getting your phone back, til
you get your shit together."

I snatched the phone. He broke down.

He said, "come on, daddy,
don't do me like that!"

(audience laughing)

He start, he start moving,

"da-- don't do me like that, daddy!"

He said, "take my leg
instead, take my leg!"

What!

Boy, give me the goddamn phone!

You're not getting the phone back,

till you get your shit together.

When I take the phone, I say
to myself, "you know what?"

"I need to go through my son's phone."

I need to see what my son
has been talking about

on his goddamn phone.

It's irresponsible on my part as a parent,

to not know what's on my son's phone.

I got to go through the
phone, people I realized

I don't have the code.

I don't got the thumbprint,
the face ID, nothing.

So I gotta go back to this little nigga,

and ask him to put the
goddamn code in the phone.

"Put the code in the phone,

so I can see what you been talking about!"

Straight face. My son said,

"nah, man, I ain't going to do it!"

(laughing) What?
(audience laughing)

"Boy, put the code in the phone,

before I punch you in the fuckin' throat!"

That's what I said.

(audience laughing)
I said that.

He took off running.

Like he don't live in this house.

Like I'm not gonna see
him at the dinner table,

in 10 minutes.
(audience laughing)

I said, "ain't nobody chasing you,

give me the codes of the phone,

before I kick you in the back!"

Swear to God from downstairs.

All I heard was, "fuck you!"

(audience laughing)
Hoh!

Oohh!
(audience laughing)

Imma kill him.

I'm about to kill him.

I run downstairs, grabbed
my son by the neck!

I start choking the shit out of my son!

"What the fuck you say to me?!"

He couldn't breathe.
He, "ahh, ahhh!"

He said, "that's the code!
The code is, fuck you!"

(audience laughing)

Oh.

That's a good code son.
That's a good code.

Is it, is it, "Y. O. U."
Or the letter, "U?"

How you spell it?
(audience laughing)

I scratched your neck up
real good, I apologize.

I'm gonna get you a turtle neck.

So you don't have to go to
school, looking like that.

I'm sorry.
(audience laughing)

Talking about my kids is a must, man.

It's a must. They're
part of my everyday life.

I don't know what else to talk about.

Outside of the things that
I go through on a daily.

My kids are with me on a daily.

Two teenagers, one three-year old,

a baby that could be here any day now.

Any day, any fuckin' day now.
(audience clapping)

About to throw these balls in the trash!

I ain't having no more fuckin' babies.

(audience laughing)

Imma roof these balls after
this fuckin' baby come.

I'm gonna take both balls,
throw 'em on a fuckin' roof!

You can kiss my ass!
(audience laughing)

Think another child is coming
out of these fuckin' balls.

I promise you that.

You a fuckin' liar, if
you say it's my baby.

Balls in the trash after this baby!

(audience laughing)

My daughter and I are closer,
than we've ever been, man.

My daughter's boy-crazy.

Boy-crazy.

Once again, I gotta act like, I like it.

I don't.

But you gotta act like you do.

I love this. I love that in
my specials, you get to see,

you get to see the growth
of my fuckin' kids.

You see their development.
They're getting older, man.

Daughter told me that she
likes this boy named Matt,

that go to her school.

"Dad, I like this boy named
Matt, Oh my God. He's so cute!"

"He makes me laugh, I want him!"

What the fuck does that mean?

(audience laughing)

What does that mean?

"I want him!"

Wha-- what the fuck are you saying?!

Little girl.
(audience laughing)

"Should I tell him?"

If that's how you feel? Honey, tell him.

My daughter goes to school,
tells the boy how she feels.

She comes home, "dad,
oh my God, guess what?"

"Matt likes me back, we're a thing!"

Good for you, honey.
That makes me happy.

Do me a favor. Keep it in
the kid's space though.

"Okay, dad."

She comes back home two days later,

"dad, I don't like Matt, no more.

I like this boy named
Rob, now. He look better.

He make me laugh more.
That's who I really want."

It happens, honey.

Sometimes you think you like somebody.

Then you meet somebody
else and you realize that's

the person that you liked
all along. It's called life.

Make it happen. Move on.

Be honest with the other person.

"All right, dad, I love you!"

Keep it in the kid's space.

(audience laughing)

A week goes by, "dad, I
don't like Rob no more.

I like this boy named Tim."

(snaps fingers)
Instantly in my mind.

I said, "my daughter a ho."

This is ho shit.
(audience laughing)

This is ho shit!

Ho activity, right in front of my face!

(audience laughing)

I immediately called a ho
that I knew from the past.

Asked her if this is how
it went down for her.

Three boys, back to back. She
said, "yup, the same way!"

(audience laughing)

Next thing, I knew I was
plucking balls in the bathroom.

What the fuck is happening!

With my baby plucking
balls. I gotta save her!

What I really gotta do, is see these boys.

Went to the school, I
just wanted to see 'em.

I wanted to see what they looked like.

I saw 'em.

Saw Matt first. Gotta be honest.

Charming little kid, personality
was out of this world.

I see why she likes Matt.

I see it, I get it.

Charming little boy, I get it.

Personality, funny guy.

I see why you like Matt, I get it.

(audience laughing)

Then Rob walked in, Rob walked in!

I didn't look at Matt again.
I-- I forgot all about Matt.

(audience laughing)

Who the fuck is Matt?
Rob had a different thing.

Personality, pop!

Had a bunch of pizzazz, flair!

Use his hands a lot, when he talked.

(audience laughing)

This kids got something.

I see why she don't like fuckin' Matt.

Then Tim walked in, Tim
had on leather pants.

(audience laughing)

In some Heelys.

You know how confident you
gotta be to wear leather pants,

in high school.

(audience laughing and clapping)

He was a black kid with leather pants.

There's no black kid, that
I've ever heard about to

ever wear leather pants,
outside of Lenny Kravitz.

That's the only black man.

(audience laughing)

And there's a rumor that
Lenny did it at a young age.

Tim had Heelys on, just slid
through the fuckin' room.

Jesus Christ, man.

Cigarettes under his arms.

I said, "do you smoke?"

He said, "it's just a look."

As he was glidin' by me.

(audience laughing)
The fuck?

These kids today are different.

My son and my daughter.

Man, they on two different pages.

Shit makes me laugh, always have been.

Always have been.

Two completely different pages.

My son is... he's what you call?
What do they call it today?

What do the kids call it today?

When the kids are, wha-- dumb!

There it is.
(audience laughing)

I got it. Dumb.

Struggling academically.

I know you guys like,
"don't call your kid dumb!"

Why not? It's mine!

(audience laughing)

Chip off the old fuckin' block,

is not like I'm standing
up here as a smart ass man.

I was dumb as shit too!

Worked out for fuckin' me.

So far, dumb is the right
way to go in my household.

(audience laughing and clapping)

It's the right way to go!

Thing that pisses me off,

is the school constantly calls me,

to remind me of my son's
educational problems.

"Mr. Hart, he failed another test."

"Mr. Hart, his grades are dropping."

"Wanna discuss your son's
grades, they continue to drop."

I snapped on em.

"Don't fuckin' call me no more!"

"Don't call me about his
grades, no more. Call him."

Call him. That's his problem.
(audience laughing)

It's not my fuckin' problem.

Last I checked. I went to school.

I passed, I'm successful.
(audience laughing)

I'm not going to school again.

He needs to fuckin pass
that class! Not me.

You know, this pandemic
actually gave me a chance

to spend a lot of time with my kids.

A lot of fuckin' time with my kids.

For the first time I realized,
my kids are a little spoiled.

They're a little spoiled,

but it's not by choice,
it's by circumstances.

I've good kids. My kids
are great fuckin' kids!

I gotta be honest, man.

I got very lucky. I got great kids,

but because of their circumstances,

they're a little spoiled.

For example,

my kids have been flying
private since they've been born.

They didn't ask for that.
They were born into that.

They only travel with me.

The first time they
traveled outside of me,

was during this pandemic, with my ex-wife.

Went back to Philadelphia with their mom

to go see their grandmom.

My kids call me from the
airport. You would've thought,

you would've thought my
kids were in Baghdad.

(audience laughing)
I've never seen,

a higher level of panic
in my fuckin' life.

Call me from the airport, "dad!"

What's happenin'?

My daughter was like,

"they're taking my
lotions and my toothpaste.

What am I supposed to do?"

(audience laughing)

They're making me walk through metal.

My son's snatched the phone,

"what the fuck is going on, dad?!"

(audience laughing)

"They won't let me take my
bags on the plane. He said,

I can't take my backpacks and
my pullies and my duffies.

Saying I gotta put my games underneath.

Well, how am I going to play 'em dad?!"

(audience laughing)

I told them both,

"relax, stop it! Stop!

Both of you. It's called security."

(audience laughing)

"It's called TSA. Okay."

"This is called life with
your mother, all right?

There's a difference."
(audience laughing)

"It's a drop-off, it's
all right. Things change.

It's okay!
You'll both be fine."

I overlooked some of the
things that I do because

I never thought twice about 'em.

Me and my kids go to the amusement park.

We do the whole park, the
whole fuckin' park, man.

30, 40 minutes.

How? Well I call ahead.

There's a concierge, they assigned to me.

I get to the park.

The concierge, walks me and my family

up to the front of every single ride.

Done it for years.
(audience laughing)

Keep in mind, I explained to my kids,

listen, this is earned. It's not given.

This doesn't just happen.

Your father worked hard to be able to walk

to the front of these fuckin' lines.

There's rules that go with this.

You don't just walk to
the front of the line.

Rule number one,

as we are walking to
the front of the line,

you do not make eye
contact with none of these

fuckin' people in this line.

(audience laughing)
You hear me?

You keep your eyes straight ahead!

And you don't fuckin' look,

left or right until we get
to the front of the line.

These people are gonna say things.

They're gonna say a lot of mean things!

About me, you, you just ignore 'em!

Fuckin' ignore 'em, because guess what?

When we're in our car, we're heading home.

We're never gonna see these people again.

(audience laughing)

You know where these
people are going to be.

They're still gonna be
in that fuckin' line,

to be honest with you.

(audience laughing and clapping)

They're still gonna be
in the fuckin' line!

That's reality.
(audience laughing)

My kids processed that.
They understood it.

For years, this is how we operated.

They call me from the amusement park.

They were with their cousins.

They FaceTime me.

I answered the FaceTime.

I could tell,

I could tell that they
were weak, malnourished.

They haven't eaten in hours. I could tell.

(audience laughing)

Had the white shit in the
corner of their mouths.

(audience laughing)

They could barely stand.

"Ah!"

"Ah!"

"Dad!"

"We've been in line for hours,

we haven't rode anything!"

"We got the fast pass,
but it's not fast at all."

(audience laughing)

"Can-- can you call somebody?
Can you do something?"

I said, "who you with, who are you with?"

"Our cousins."

"Is your mother there?"

"Yes."

"Put your mom on the phone,
let me talk to your mom."

Gave their mom the phone, she
said, "hey, what's up Kev?"

"Hey...

checkmate, bitch!"

I hung up the phone. Bop!

(audience laughing and clapping)

It was quick.
