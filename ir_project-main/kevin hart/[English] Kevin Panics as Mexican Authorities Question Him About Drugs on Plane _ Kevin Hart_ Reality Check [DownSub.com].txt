Look, if they want to go through your

bags, all you got to do is grab the bag

without the drugs. If they don't, then

grab the bag with the drugs.

That's how we get the drugs through.

We alternate it like that.

Everybody on the plane was like, "Bet

." "Dope." "Yeah, let's do it." I said,

that don't work for me. I don't like

that plan. I don't f****** like it.

My name on my bag. Don't touch my bag.

You touch my bag. I'll tell.

I'll f****** tell. I'll never forget

it. It's a true story. We're landing in

Mexico. Plane goes down.

I look out the window, look like an

episode of Narcos. I've never seen more

Mexican officers in my godd*** life.

They stay in the air. They got the

dogs. I've never seen dogs look through

the window of a plane.

The dogs. When I saw that, when I saw

the dogs, I said, Oh, boy, y'all going

to jail? Y'all going to f****** jail?

They smell it. The dogs smell it

already. Little Mexican man comes on a

plane after the door goes down.

He starts speaking Spanish.

Keep in mind, I don't know Spanish.

I know a couple of words, and I know

the rhythm. I know the rhythm of

Spanish. For the purpose of this joke,

I'm gonna hit you with the rhythm.

The reason why is because I want you to

feel like you were there.

I'm telling you ahead of time.

These are not real words, okay?

They're not real words.

It's going to sound like it, but it's

just the rhythm. But don't make me

laugh because I got to stay in the

character. Don't make me f****** laugh.

So he started off he started off calm

and then escalated. This is exactly

what he did. Okay.

Donde? Donde.

Donde. Donde esta?

Hmm? Donde esta nuera?. Nuera.

Que tiaro. Salty Sotto siete.

[Fake Spanish]

Looking right at me. He looked at me

dead in the f****** eye. He go, que,

que. I don't know what the f*** que

mean. But he wanted an answer.

He looked right at me. I panicked.

I didn't know what to f****** do.

I panicked. I said, queso.

So I just said it.

I said, queso.

I thought about the cheese.

Queso cheese. I don't know what the

f***. Queso.

He thought I was being a smart ass.

He said Oh.

Queso.

No diano.

No diano.

You ever hear Spanish people talk real

fast and it just sounds like a bunch of

clicks? This is this is what he said.

[Fast speaking Spanish]

[Fast

speaking Spanish] Exito!

This is my nightmare. We going to jail.

I get up. I got my hands up.

I'm cooperating. We get off the plane.

They got a security booth right there.

You got to get in the booth one by one.

When you get in the booth, you got to

press the button. When you press the

button, it go red light or green light.

Let me tell you something right now, if

you press that button and you get a red

light, you can cancel Christmas.

It's over for you. You hear me?

It's over for you.

It get dark as f*** when you press that

button. It's red.

[Fake Spanish]

You press the button, it's green,

they're a different person get.

Que pasa! Put a f****** hat on you and

start dancing. Dum, dum, dum.

You don't want to dance, but you're

scared. So you do it anyway.

Please don't kill me.

I'm first. I got to press the f******

button. He's looking right at me.

I almost said.

I almost said they got drugs.

I swear to God, I was f****** nervous.

My stomach was bubbling, my ass was

wet. I was farting.

It was too much. I was nervous.
